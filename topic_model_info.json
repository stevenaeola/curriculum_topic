","Undergraduate Course: Computer Architecture and Design (INFR10076) In this course you will learn how to design a computer and understand the performance characteristics of computers. You will first acquire a working knowledge of digital design, through the Verilog Hardware Description Language, along with a good theoretical grounding in the design of the key components of a microprocessor. You will have an opportunity to learn, both theoretically and practically, how the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture enables computer architects to analyse and optimize microprocessors to maximize performance. Along the way you will design real hardware, and later in the course you will apply your recently-acquired knowledge of quantitative computer architecture to analyse a simulated system and optimize its performance. The aim of this course is to give students a comparatively deep understanding of computer architecture, to an intermediate level, together with a solid understanding of techniques used to design the logical building blocks from which a computer is constructed. We consider an intermediate level in computer architecture to extend up to the point where students have a good understanding of instruction set architecture, single-issue in-order pipelined execution of instructions, superscalar out-of-order execution, and the memory hierarchies required by those processors. Within a processor, we explore the principles and practice of arithmetic and logic unit design, of the caches from which memory hierarchies are constructed, and the memory and logic gate technologies from which computers are constructed. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture; this informs not only the theoretical topics but also the practical assignments, which always embody some element of the quantitative approach. \n \nThe philosophy of this course is that learning about computer architecture is particularly effective if reinforced by implementing key aspects of processor design, in real hardware when feasible, but also at higher levels of abstraction using simulated systems. This approach has been used very effectively in the previous Computer Design and Computer Architecture courses, and feedback often cites the value placed on the lab exercises by students. \n \nOutline Contents \n \nFundamentals \nReview of logic design and implementation technologies; from simple combinational logic to state machines for sequential circuits; logic design using Verilog and introduction to FPGAs. \nRegister Transfer Level design principles; registers, clocks, timing budgets, setup and hold margins, clock skew, clock-domain crossing and synchronization, metastability. \nQuantitative computer architecture; performance evaluation methods and metrics, principles of high-performance design. \n \nProcessor Architecture \nInstruction Set Architecture (ISA) design; instruction set classes, registers, memory addressing.

This course presents an introduction to the two main branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. At the heart of both lies the notion of the limit of a function, sequence, or series. In addition to promoting a conceptual appreciation of these foundations of calculus, the course will develop calculational facility, both of which are essential for further mathematical study. \n \nA suggested syllabus for the course is as follows. Functions. Limits and continuity. Differentiation: techniques and applications. Inverse functions. Integration: techniques and applications. Fundamental theorem of calculus. Sequences and series. Taylor and Maclaurin series. Differential equations, moments, and exponential growth. It is probably fair to say that calculus represents one of the biggest achievements in the history of human thought. It took mankind almost two millennia to go from Archimedes first attempts to estimate areas to the birth of the subject as we know it today with the work of Newton and Leibniz in the 1600s and even after that it took another two centuries before the foundations of the subject were firmly laid. \nIn that sense, calculus marks the birth of modern mathematics: its influence on scientific and technological developments over the centuries since its inception cannot be overstated. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to calculus; the focus will be firmly on the two traditional branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Roughly speaking, the former is concerned with rates of change (\"derivatives\"), while the latter studies accumulated quantities (\"integrals\"). The connection between the two is established by the fundamental theorem of calculus which lies at the heart of the subject, and which in turn relies on the notion of the limit of a function.  \nThe course will explore some of the implications of these and related notions, and will cover a variety of techniques and applications of both differentiation and integration; examples include the mean value theorem, curve sketching, and (unconstrained or constrained) optimisation, as well as areas and volumes, arc length, and improper integrals. The convergence of infinite sequences and series will be another focus in the course. Further applications may include (elementary) differential equations from physics, ecology, and engineering, moments from probability theory, and growth models from economics \nDepending on the mode of delivery, lectures or screencasts on assigned reading will be augmented through (formal and informal) collaborative discussion, thus implementing a \"flipped classroom\" setting. Real-time workshops will involve group-based activities to cement concepts, and expand on applications introduced in lectures or screencasts. Opportunities for practice will be provided through worksheets, online quizzes, and biweekly written homework.   On completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n     \n         Demonstrate an understanding of limits and continuous functions by evaluating and manipulating them.  Exhibit fluency in differentiation by identifying and applying standard techniques for evaluating derivatives.  Exhibit fluency in integration by identifying and applying standard techniques for evaluating integrals.  Apply calculus to a variety of mathematical applications that include curve sketching,optimisation problems and the calculation of rates of change, areas, and volumes.  Demonstrate a basic understanding of infinite sequences and series by describing their convergence properties. \n     ","Mathematics and Computation   Summary module description:   \n  An introduction to mathematics which is relevant to computer science, including linear algebra, probability and statistics.

On the one hand, cryptographic techniques are necessary to protect the security and privacy of users when using technology and communication networks. In particular, it is important to protect users from mass surveillance activities that can be carried out illegally not only by private companies but also by some government agencies operating outside of legal circuits. On the other hand, beyond the protection of users, companies and any entity that is related to or uses technology needs mechanisms that protect their digital assets, which can sometimes be all the assets of a company. Finally, the development of cryptography also allows the birth of new relationship paradigms between people such as the creation of new virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, which do not depend on any centralized entity to function.\n\nThe subject wants to give a practical approach to cryptography, and that is why the subject is structured jointly based on both theoretical and practical content that is complemented by programming activities that allow us to know the real problems that arise in the implementation of cryptographic systems. The contents of the subject are detailed below, grouping the different modules that make it up into thematic blocks:\n\nUnit 1: Basic concepts\n\nBasic terminology as well as the historical evolution of cryptography are studied.

This block includes modules 1 and 2.\n\n    Module 1: Introduction to cryptography\n    Module 2: Mathematical Fundamentals\n\nUnit 2: Shared Key Cryptography\n\nThe two large families of shared-key cryptosystems are studied: block cipher and flow cipher. For each family, its main properties are characterized and the most relevant cryptosystems are studied. On the other hand, hash functions are defined, focusing on their properties and applications and analyzing in depth one of its most relevant implementations: SHA256. This block includes modules 3 and 4.\n\n    Module 3: Symmetric Key Cryptography\n    Module 4: Hash functions\n\nUnit 3: Public Key Ciphers\n\nThe characterization of the most important properties of public key cryptosystems is given, emphasizing topics such as key distribution, digital signatures, the combination between public key\/symmetric key, as well as relevant aspects of the implementation of public key cryptography. . . Finally, the architecture and protocols associated with public key infrastructures (Public Key Infrastructure, PKI) are studied. This block includes modules 5 and 6.\n\n    Module 5: Public Key Cryptography\n    Module 6: Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\n\nUnit 4: Cryptographic protocols\n\nThe cryptographic primitives described throughout the course are put into practice for the development of cryptographic protocols, such as secret sharing, null-knowledge proofs, unconscious transfer, or secure multipart computing.

The emphasis is on developing practical programming skills,   applying  &nbsp;advanced techniques such as monads, parallelism, metaprogramming, and formal methods.    The aims are to understand the principles of functional programming, including functions, expressions, types, type inference, equational reasoning, and monads, and to develop the ability to solve substantial programming problems using Haskell.     By the end of the course students will be able to:    1.   Write simple programs involving elementary Haskell techniques, including pure function definitions;     2.

From computer science comes machine learning, cloud computing, and databases; from statistics, a long tradition of exploratory data analysis, modelling, inference, hypothesis testing and visualisation; from application domains in business and science, comes the challenges to tackle, the questions to answer, and the evaluation standards to assess the relevance of the insights and results obtained.&nbsp; \n\n\n The main goal of data science is to extract knowledge and insight from data, which can then be turned into positive action. There is a multitude of data science applications in science, industry, and society. &nbsp; \n\n\n Data Science Applications starts by setting the scene and discussing what data science and big data are and why they matter. It then moves on to describe the data science process and how it is applied in a variety of contexts from scientific to commercial. This is supported by specific case studies and a set of invited talks by data science designers and practitioners from science and industry.&nbsp; \n\n\n The module does not cover computer programming or hands-on data analysis.

","Undergraduate Course: Entrepreneurship and Innovation Project (INFR09053) The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Project course enables Informatics students to approach real life problems with an entrepreneurial perspective, through developing their ability to apply disciplinary knowledge, resources and academic skills. The teaching environment for the EIP course will be in-person, face-to-face, with a core teaching facilitator who organises the weekly lesson plans, the guest lecturers, and who serves as a facilitator and introducer of weekly learning. Teaching will be delivered in a way that enables students to build on their entrepreneurial knowledge each week through formal and informal interactions with the course organiser. The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Project covers three levels of cognitive domains (Knowledge, Comprehension, and Application): it exposes the enrolled students to entrepreneurial knowledge, and then teaches them how to explain and represent their new knowledge through applying it to constructing a solution to a problem that they have identified. Students will be assessed on their ability to develop and execute a semester-long project and team management plan. On a weekly basis, each individual in the team will be required to reflect on\/provide a personal perspective of the effectiveness of their teamwork. Like a real-life business with co-founders, the EIP course requires students face and address challenges as a team. \n \nStudent teams will be provided with formative assessment throughout the semester on the basis of their contributions to weekly reflective exercises, which evaluate their progress on collaboratively planning for and presenting a group business plan as their final project. All students will be required to attend weekly business planning workshops, which will guide students on how to research for and populate sections of their business plans that will be assessed as a summative portfolio of each team's collaborative learning journey throughout the semester. Weekly class attendance and effective team work are both essential in order for students to get a good grade for EIP. \n \nThe EIP course provides students with an opportunity to define and engage with an entrepreneurial project that they can continue pursue beyond the 1-semester of the EIP course delivery. \n \nThe course organiser of EIP will provide students with a guided learning pathway, which enables the teaching team (organiser and tutors) to get to know the individual teams 'intimately' through the semester, so as to offer them individualised\/team-specific feedback within the context of the larger learning outcomes and with regard to the components of the business plan that are assessed for a final team and individual grade. On completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n     \n         identify appropriate market segments for their innovations and justify decision to choose one market over another  communicate the process through which they achieve their final product to stakeholders  differentiate and appraise the different aspects of business models, financial plans and customer channels  collaboratively construct a business plan and model associated financial statements (for their entrepreneurial idea)  work as a member of a team to demonstrate multidisciplinary application of their Informatics' knowledge and skills to delivering an entrepreneurial solution \n     ","Enterpreneurship New business opportunities appear every day to respond to previously non-existent or unsatisfied needs or to improve the existing offer. In addition, organizations increasingly value having an entrepreneurial organizational culture and encourage people who work to act as entrepreneurs in the same organization. And it has been shown that there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurship and the development of a country or region. Among other characteristics, it contributes to economic growth, is a source of innovation, favors job creation and contributes to social cohesion and dynamism.\n\nIn this sense, the Entrepreneurial Initiative subject aims to promote the entrepreneurial spirit of students from the introduction to the main elements that make up the entrepreneurial process from an applied and practical approach. Firstly, we will introduce ourselves to the entrepreneurial phenomenon, analyzing various typologies and taking into account the gender perspective.

The emphasis of this module is on innovation relevant to the student's chosen study pathway.  The balance of activities will depend on the specific objectives of the topics covered but the problem is intended to provide challenges and learning experiences that further help develop the student's insight into their intended career pathway within a simulated working environment, and develop their competence to operate successfully. It is a group-based project and the work completed within this module by an individual student will require the student to work with other students following the same module. Project groups are normally expected to be multidisciplinary and to be able to integrate different professional working practices. At this programme level the group are also expected to be able to develop innovative solutions to a problem challenge and apply appropriate professional practices. Students are expected to demonstrate significant autonomy in planning, selection of resources and (within set guidelines) defining the deliverables that demonstrate their concept and evidence its viability. By prior agreement with module tutors, students on certain pathways may be permitted to work individually on responses to external competition briefs but will still be expected to engage in peer assessment and critiquing activities. Groups are expected to develop their own code of conduct that members will follow and choose their own documentation and management standards, and to document the working practices they have followed in support of evidencing the group's professionalism. As well as reflecting on their personal performance (strengths and weaknesses, professional development needs), students will also undertake peer reflection and evaluation. The primary assessable outcome of the project will be an artefact appropriate to the problem set, developed through significant coordinated practical work, together with supporting documentation. The assessment will include an evaluation of the level of professionalism which teams and individuals have adopted within their work.

The balance of activities will depend on the specific objectives of the topics covered but the problem is intended to provide challenges and learning experiences that further help develop the student's insight into practices and skills associated with their intended career pathway within a working environment, and develop their competence to operate successfully as part of a team. The project will be undertaken on an individual basis, however, the work completed within the module is likely to require the GA to work with groups of individuals within the organisation. Therefore, the GA can assume the role of a project leader or significant project member carrying out a role of responsibility on the project. Where more than one GA on this module is working within the same team in the workplace then this may be assessed as a group project. Project specifications\/design briefs are expected to be derived from the student's workplace. At this programme level the GA is expected to contribute significantly to the development and conduct of a project plan framed around a relevant development process for a well-defined problem area under direct supervision of a work based supervisor and a module tutor and work towards well defined deliverables that meet defined requirements using specified resources.  The GA requires to work in a self-motivated way, coordinated with colleagues and within collectively defined schedules ,further developing confidence in their ability to work with others on analysing and creatively solving problems. As well as reflecting on their personal performance (strengths and weaknesses, professional development needs), GAs will also reflect upon strengths and weakness of the team and relevant professional and ethical issues introduced.  The primary assessable outcome of the project will be an artefact appropriate to the problem set, developed through significant coordinated practical work, together with supporting documentation. The assessment will include an evaluation of the level of professionalism which teams and individuals have adopted within their work.

"],"48":["Data Analysis Portfolio Assessment  \n \n\n \n   \n \n This assessment sees apprentices developing their probabilistic reasoning and skills in collecting, analysing and organising data and information using relative statistical techniques. Apprentices will apply their knowledge through practice by conveying their ideas clearly and fluently via three main components (consisting of either a written assignment or statistical report).  The first two components see students applying fundamental techniques in probability and statistics to a number of smaller data science probability and statistics problems. This will comprise of two small written assignments.  The final component will consist of a more substantial written statistical report making use of a statistical software package (R). Apprentices will use real life data to conduct basic qualitative and quantitative analyses. The focus of the analyses should be a grounded interpretation of the datasets with a narrative of how these findings relate to the wider discipline of data science.  The portfolio assessments across this programme provide an opportunity for apprentices to understand how to start structuring a portfolio of evidence to demonstrates the acquisition and application of knowledge, skills and behaviours in line with the apprenticeship standard. &nbsp;One of the conditions for passing through the gateway and on to the end point assessment is a portfolio of evidence which can be used as the basis for the professional discussion in the end point assessment. &nbsp;This therefore helps the apprentices in understanding the expectations and practice in the preparation of an assessed portfolio before reaching the gateway review.&nbsp; &nbsp; \n \n  Can calculate probabilities and moments using probability mass and density functions &nbsp;Can calculate simple properties of discrete bivariate random variables&nbsp; &nbsp;Can state and apply the central limit theorem &nbsp;Can conduct appropriate hypothesis tests for a variety of situations, and calculate p-values.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can fit and analyse linear models with one covariate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can analyse categorical data by testing proportions and independence of two variables.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can use statistical software to carry out calculations and interpret the output. &nbsp; KSBs K2.\u202fHow Data Science operates within the context of data governance, data security, and\u202fcommunications.

"],"52":["Use of information systems in organizations The subject Use of Information Systems in Organizations (USIO) has a deductive approach; that is, through the study and work of cases, the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in organizations is analyzed. This approach allows establishing conclusions and interpretations whose purpose is to understand the efficient use of ICT in management and business decision making.\n\nThe course is based on solving a case throughout the semester by working in interdisciplinary groups. The students of the Degrees in Computer Engineering (GII) and Business Administration and Management (ADE) will share a work space in which they will develop the activities of the subject. This point is very important and the student should consider it before enrolling. Unlike other subjects where there is detailed material to work on for further assessment, the USIO does not have material that the student must study in the classical sense. A group must be formed and work must be done on the approach of a case with contents of business information systems. The development must be collaborative and although some recommended readings are given, searches on the Internet or other sources must also be carried out, proposing a coherent and argued solution. It is not possible to think that there is \"the solution\" in the style of a mathematical exercise, there are several possible ones and the consultant will evaluate the different alternatives with pre-established criteria (indicated as part of the statement). Group work dynamics are usually complex and in this sense it is very important to form a cohesive group that is willing to work from the beginning. Case title: \"PARROT\"\n\nAffair:\n\nThe subject Use of Information Systems in Organizations (USIO) is based on the development of a case study. We will focus on the case of LORO. It is intended to be a first approximation to the resolution of technological innovations to which companies must tend so as not to disappear in the future. The question that management teams in any organization must ask themselves is whether current products and services will continue to be marketed in the future. In the case of PARROT, a drone manufacturer, the help of a consultant is being considered to carry out a detailed study in five phases to take advantage of the disruptive technologies that are appearing in the current digital revolution.\n\n\nThe topics to be studied in this case are the following:\n\nEmerging technologies according to the Gartner Hype Cycle.\nDigital Twins technology (Digital Twins) applied to an organization.\nThe application of Conversational Intelligence technology to the manufacturing sector and its ethical concerns.\nImproving an organization's processes through hyperautomation and process mining\nMetaverse technology applied to a manufacturing organization.\nThe students will be organized in groups to propose a detailed study to PARROT as a consultant. The case has been structured into five PECs corresponding to the five phases that the study will carry out to allow PARROT to take advantage of disruptive technologies; the first will be developed individually and the rest will be done in groups.\n\nSummary of Goals by Milestones:\n\n- PEC 1.- Reading, understanding the case. Gartner Hype Cycle analysis to detect emerging technologies to apply.\n\nUnderstand the case and analyze the technologies included in the Gartner Hype Cycle titled \"Hype Cycle for Mobile Robots and Drones, 2022\" published on July 19, 2022 by Dwight Klappich, to consider which 2 emerging technologies (since Innovation Trigger or Peak of Inflated Expectations ) could use Parrot, which could offer them the creation of new business models or economic growth\n\n- PEC 2.- Analysis of the application of Digital Twins Technology (Digital Twins) in an organization.\n\nExplore how PARROT could take advantage of the Digital Twins technology trend.\n\n- PEC 3.- Analysis of the application of Conversational Intelligence Technology in an organization.\n\nAnalyze what possibilities of applying Conversational Intelligence such as ChatGPT to the manufacturing sector. And discuss what are the ethical concerns of using conversational intelligence like ChatGPT.\n\n- PEC 4.- Analysis of the application of Hyperautomation and Process Mining in an organization.\n\nAnalyze how PARROT could carry out different initiatives to improve operational processes by applying hyperautomation, through Robotic Process Automation technology or Business Process Management Workflow Engines or Process Mining technologies\nGet Celonis certified through the 10-hour Process Mining Fundamentals course.\n\n- PEC 5.- Analysis of the application of the Metaverse in an organization.\n\nAnalyze how PARROT could take advantage of the technological trend of the Metaverse. ","Foundations of information systems The continuous innovations in information and communication technologies are transforming the corporate business world into new models, new processes and new business needs. This environment has favored the investments of the companies to be more competitive in the current market, allocating a budget to the acquisition, implementation or updating of information systems.\n\nIn this topic we present the basic concepts of information systems, the types of information systems, the relevance of information systems for companies, what the first information systems were like, how they have evolved and what the systems of the system have to contribute. future. In companies\n\nWe will know the main information system: Enterprise Resource Planning, today also known as basic or traditional.\n\nWe will see how the incorporation of new functionalities in the evolution of ERP systems gives rise to new collaborative information systems: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supplier Chain Management (SCM) or Business Intelligence (BI).\n\nAnd a transversal theme to any company information system, its implementation. We will cover the life cycle of an implementation project, the characteristics of its different phases, the problems and what guidelines to follow to obtain a successful implementation. The concept of information system is gradually introduced in the different didactic modules: beginning with its definition, presenting the different types of information systems that exist, showing the most important information systems for companies, and ending with a module on how to these systems are implemented. in companies it is managed.\n\nThe content of the subject is divided into the following didactic modules:\n\nModule 0.

Practical Case: Rural Tourism (Example)\n\nPresentation of the practical case\nGeneral solution approach\nProposed solution ","Planning and strategic use of IS The mission of this course is to introduce students of Computer Engineering and other careers to the basics to understand the strategic uses of technology in organizations and the management and strategic planning of information systems. In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.\n\nThis is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.\n\nInformation systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (\"management\"), in its broadest sense; After all, \"IT management is all about management\" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).\n\nThe above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say \"strategic management\", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.\n\nThis course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:\n\nWhat are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?\nHow should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?\nHow can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?\nWhat are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?\nHow information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?\nHow can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?\nHow can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?\n\nAdditionally, currently there is talk of \"digital transformation\", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information. The learning units are the following:\n\n\nModule 1: Strategic Decisions in Information Systems and Technologies.\n\nModule 2: Information Technologies and Business Strategy.\n\nModule 3: Information Technologies and Business Processes.\n\nModule 4: Information and Knowledge Management.\n\nModule 5: Strategic Planning of Information Systems and Technologies.\n\nModule 6: Transformation of the information systems management function.\n\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that some of these materials may be common to the subject of Strategic Management of Information Systems at the Master's level. At grade level, these competencies are worked on in a different way and with different levels of depth. The teaching guides that will accompany each module or other complementary materials will provide specific instructions on how to carry out an adequate follow-up of the subject.
