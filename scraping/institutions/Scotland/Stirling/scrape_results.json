Usually, there is a structured information source, and a scripting language to present the content. This module introduces you to two of the most popular technologies for creating such a website.</p>\n\n\n<p>Relational databases are ways of organising information. You\u2019ll cover ways to design a good structure, theories that confirm the structure is good (normalisation), practical implementation using SQL, including using this query language to retrieve the information.</p>\n\n\n<p>To create the web-based interface you\u2019ll meet PHP, a scripting language. PHP allows you to create web pages, to connect to databases and send instructions such as queries, and to display the information returned from queries. These are key skills for web implementation roles, but are also useful in many other technology careers.</p>\n\n\n\n                <h3 class=\"header-stripped u-bg-heritage-green--10 u-heritage-green-line-left u-p-1 u-border-width-5 u-text-regular u-mt-2\">\n                    Learning outcomes\n                </h3>\n                <p><strong>After successful completion of this module, you'll be able to:</strong></p>\n                <ul><li>demonstrate a practical and theoretical knowledge of Database Management Systems and their role in Information Systems in any context;</li> <li>demonstrate the ability to design and implement a practical relational database using entity-relationship modelling and normalisation to give the data a regular structure;</li> <li>demonstrate the ability to implement a practical relational database using SQL with a PHP interface;</li> <li>demonstrate an understanding of the general principles of database management, including distributed databases and transaction processing;</li> <li>be able to specify how the storage and processing of data is affected by data protection legislation, such as GDPR and FOI.</li></ul>",

An industrial placement provides the opportunity to apply the knowledge you have gained in the classroom in a commercial context and gain valuable experiences. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Placements are typically between 8 and 12 weeks long. Most placements are paid, and so the employers will make the final decision on which student they are employing. It is your responsibility to secure a placement, but staff will assist. Placement opportunities will be advertised during the preceding spring semester but you are also encouraged to source opportunities from public job advertisements and your own networks, including friends and family. Placements are commonly advertised on e-Placement Scotland and Target Connect. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Working in an industrial setting will give you valuable skills and make you more employable on graduation.

There is a multitude of data science applications in science, industry, and society. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Data Science Applications starts by setting the scene and discussing what data science and big data are and why they matter.

This is left to other modules in the programme. The idea is instead to provide a high-level discussion of important principles and study the conceptual steps of the data science process, with more in-depth coverage of some relevant techniques and case studies.

Just as we need our money to be stored securely but with ease of access, companies also need data to be both secure and accessible. What\u2019s more, there is no point in keeping secure, accessible data if you don\u2019t make use of it, so the final aspect of data strategy is concerned with how an organisation makes use of its data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, data strategy covers data security, data access and data utilisation. Getting these things right allows an organisation to become more effective and exposed to less risk.
