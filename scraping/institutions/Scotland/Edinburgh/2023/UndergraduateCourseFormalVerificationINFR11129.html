<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">Formal verification is the use of mathematical techniques to verify the correctness of various kinds of engineering systems: software systems and digital hardware systems, for example. Formal verification techniques are exhaustive and provide much stronger guarantees of correctness than testing or simulation-based approaches. They are particularly useful for safety and security critical systems and for when system behaviour is highly complex. The course focuses on automated techniques that are currently used in industry. It gives practical exposure to current formal verification tools, explaining the input languages used and introducing the underlying mathematical techniques and algorithms used for automation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    In recent years there have been highly noteworthy cases of the adoption of formal verification (FV) techniques in industry. For example, at Intel, FV has largely replaced simulation-based verification of their microprocessors, at Microsoft, FV is used to certify that 3rd party drivers are free of certain kinds of concurrency bugs. As FV tools and methodologies improve, FV is expected to become more and more widely used in industry. <br>
 <br>
This course aims to familiarise students with main classes of FV techniques that are likely to become most widespread in industry in the coming years. The intent is to prepare students who might go into industry with sufficient background in FV that they would be aware of when and how they might deploy FV techniques. The course will also be of interest to students who wish to go into research developing techniques for future-generation FV tools and who might need to use FV in their research. To satisfy these aims, the course has a practical focus, giving students hands-on experience with a number of tools and explaining their input languages for specifying systems and desired system properties. The course also introduces the underlying mathematical techniques, which gives students a deeper understanding of the tools and will help them use the tools most effectively. <br>
 <br>
Topics the course covers include the following: <br>
*Formal verification in context, its current take-up in industry and challenges to its wider <br>
adoption <br>
*Syntax and semantics of CTL and LTL temporal logics <br>
*CTL and LTL model checking techniques, including automata-based approaches and <br>
bounded model checking with SAT solvers <br>
*The BDD data-structure used at the heart of many model checkers <br>
*Writing models for model checking and phrasing useful properties in CTL and LTL <br>
*Operational semantics of a simple imperative programming language, weakest precondition <br>
operators and verification condition generation <br>
*The capabilities of SMT solvers for discharging verification conditions <br>
*Assertion-based software verification <br>
 <br>
Optional topics include: <br>
*Industrial temporal logics such as PSL and SVA used in hardware verification <br>
*Formal verification case studies <br>
*Formal verification of hybrid systems, system with both discrete state changes and <br>
continuous state changes governed by differential equations <br>
*Combining formal and simulation-based verification methods <br>
*Dual use of temporal logic properties and assertions in formal and simulation-based <br>
verification of hardware and software  <br>
*Software model checking, focusing on its use for finding concurrency bugs <br>
*Pattern-based detection of concurrency bugs

The course material is primarily introduced in lectures and assessment is by a final exam. Practical exercises are provided to give students familiarity with formal verification tools and help them better understand formal verification techniques. Support for students in using the tools is provided both by demonstrators in lab sessions and through the use of an online discussion forum. In addition, demonstrators review student solutions to exercises and the lecturer both introduces the exercises and presents model solutions.<br>
<br>
As the course focuses on the application of formal verification techniques, most exam questions will involve presenting various verification scenarios and exploring how verification techniques might be deployed in those scenarios. Often questions will focus on some particular aspect of a techniques, exploring for example how well students understand the input specification languages used by techniques. Other questions might involve students stepping through the behaviour of verification algorithms on small examples.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">An online discussion forum will provide one channel for feedback on all aspects of the course, including replies to questions concerning lectures, practical exercises and previous<br>
exams. <br>
<br>
Lectures will include feedforward introductory presentations on the practical exercises and walkthroughs and discussion of model answers to the exercises.<br>
<br>
Demonstrators in labs will be available for providing feedback on students work on the practical exercises on a as-needed basis. In addition, students will be able to book slots, maybe 15 mins in length, during which a demonstrator can systematically walk through students work and compare it with model solutions.<br>
<br>
We will consider recommending students work in pairs on the exercises, so they have the benefit of peer feedback. Students could also meet with demonstrators in these pairs, which would enable demonstrator resources to be stretched further and possibly could enable longer demonstrator meeting times.</td>
