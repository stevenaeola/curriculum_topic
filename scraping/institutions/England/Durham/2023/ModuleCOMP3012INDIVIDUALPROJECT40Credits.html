		</ul><h4 id="fhaims">Aims</h4><ul>
			<li>To allow students to conduct a substantial piece of research into an unfamiliar area of Computing Science.</li>
			<li>To introduce the research methods and skills relevant for conducting such a project.</li>
			<li>To provide an opportunity for students to synthesise what theyâ€™ve learned from other modules.</li>
			<li>To give students experience of working independently.</li>
			<li>To give students experience in writing up and presenting work in a scholarly fashion.</li>
		</ul><h4 id="fhcontent">Content</h4><ul>
			<li>Students are expected to choose a project from a list offered by potential supervisors, or to propose their own project and find a suitable supervisor.</li>
			<li>Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied in the topic they address and in the type of approach required.</li>
			<li>For example they may be practically or theoretically based. Many projects will consist of a combination of these.</li>
			<li>All projects allow opportunity for initiative by the student, and are open-ended in that they offer the potential for considerably more work than can be achieved in the available time.</li>
			<li>Project selection and a compulsory course on successfully conducting a project will take place during the Easter term of the 2nd year.</li>
			<li>Project work starts at the beginning of the 3rd year.</li>
			<li>One of the main outcomes of the project is a significant academic-quality report.</li>
			<li>Successful completion requires good organisation, communication skills and management.</li>
			<li>Management is the responsibility of the student, in regular consultation with the supervisor.</li>
		</ul><h4 id="fhlearn">Learning Outcomes</h4>

		<h4 id="fhmodes">Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute to
the learning outcomes of the module</h4><ul>
			<li>Students are taught the expectations for the management of
      their project through the lecture series and personal subject based tuition
      is given within their tutorials.</li>
			<li>Students will receive regular process meetings with their
      supervisor giving formative feedback on the suitability of the implementation and
      scientific report.</li>
			<li>The research conducted and the implementation developed will
      be written up in the form of the scientific report along with presentations of the work in the form of oral presentations.</li>
