			<li>Level 4 project modules in any other Department.</li>
		</ul><h4 id="fhaims">Aims</h4><ul>
			<li>To allow students to conduct, via individual initiative, a substantial piece of research into an unfamiliar area of Computing Science.</li>
			<li>To allow students to propose, develop and critically evaluate their work. </li>
			<li>To allow students to evaluate and select the most appropriate research methods and skills relevant for conducting their project. </li>
			<li>To provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate originality in their application of the knowledge they have gained throughout their degree, along with the ability to identify appropriate gaps in their knowledge and conduct independent learning to address these gaps. </li>
			<li>To critically analyse background literature within their chosen domain in order to set their work in context. </li>
			<li>To enhance students skills in writing up and presenting work in a scholarly fashion. </li>
		</ul><h4 id="fhcontent">Content</h4><ul>
			<li>Students are expected to choose a project from a list offered by potential supervisors, or to propose their own project and find a suitable supervisor.</li>
			<li>Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied in the topic they address and in the type of approach required; the common factor is that they are research-led.</li>
			<li>For example they may be practically or theoretically based. Many projects will consist of a combination of these.</li>
			<li>All projects are open-ended and contain considerably more work than can be achieved in the available time. Students therefore need to evaluate the problem domain and propose the elements of the greater problem they will address.</li>
			<li>Project work starts at the beginning of the 4th year.</li>
			<li>One of the main outcomes of the project is a significant academic-quality report.</li>
			<li>Successful completion requires good organisation, communication skills and management.</li>
			<li>Management is the responsibility of the student, in regular consultation with the supervisor.</li>
		</ul><h4 id="fhlearn">Learning Outcomes</h4>

		<h4 id="fhmodes">Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute to
the learning outcomes of the module</h4><ul>
			<li>A series of lectures presents the advances skills required in conducting a high-quality project.</li>
			<li>Students will receive regular process meetings with their supervisor giving formative feedback on the suitability of the implementation and scientific report.</li>
			<li>The research conducted and the implementation developed will be written up in the form of the scientific report along with presentations of their work in the form of posters.</li>
