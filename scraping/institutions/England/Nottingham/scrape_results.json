These databases need to be both easy to use and fast. This module considers both the structure of databases, including how to make them fast, efficient and reliable, and the appropriate user interfaces which will make them easy to interact with for users. You will start by looking at how to design a database, gaining an understanding of the standard features that management systems provide and how you can best utilise them and then develop an interactive application to access your database. Throughout the lectures and computing sessions you will learn how to design and implement systems using a standard database management system, web technologies and GUI interfaces through practical programming/system examples. You will spend around three hours per week in lectures and two hours per week in organised computer labs studying for this module, and will be expected to spend additional time practising and completing your coursework.</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>",

The field of Big Data has many different faces such as databases, security and privacy, visualisation, computational infrastructure or data analytics/mining. This module will provide the following concepts:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1. \u202fIntroduction to Big data: introducing the main principles behind distributed/parallel systems with data intensive applications, identifying key challenges: capture, store, search, analyse and visualise the data.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>2. SQL Databases vs. NoSQL Databases: understand the growing amounts of data; the relational database management systems (RDBMS); overview of Structured Query Languages (e.g. SQL); introduction to NoSQL databases; understanding the difference between a relational DBMS and a NoSQL database; Identifying the need to employ a NoSQL DB.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3. Big Data frameworks and how to deal with big data: this includes the MapReduce programming model, as well as an overview of recent technologies (Hadoop ecosystem, and Apache Spark). Then, you will learn how to interact with the latest APIs of Apache Spark (RDDs, DataFrames and Datasets) to create distributed programs capable of dealing with big datasets (using Python and/or Scala)\u202f&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>4. Finally, we will dive into the data mining and machine learning part of the course, including data preprocessing approaches (to obtain quality data), distributed machine learning algorithms and data stream algorithms. To do so, you will use the Machine learning library of Apache Spark (MLlib) to understand how some machine learning algorithms (e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, k-means) can be deployed at a scale.</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>",

You will learn the theory and mathematics behind commonly used algorithms, and how cryptographic primitives are used to build modern secure systems. Topics will include both private and public key encryption schemes, common algorithms and cryptanalysis, key exchange, hash functions, and elliptic curve cryptography. Important applications of these techniques such as cryptographic protocols, digital signatures and Public Key Infrastructure will also be covered. Students will learn how to evaluate the strength of algorithms, make informed decisions on their selection, and how to make use of cryptographic techniques in practice.</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>",

One of the conditions for passing through the gateway and on to the end point assessment is a portfolio of evidence which can be used as the basis for the professional discussion in the end point assessment. This therefore helps the apprentices in understanding the expectations and practice in the preparation of an assessed portfolio before reaching the gateway review. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>",
