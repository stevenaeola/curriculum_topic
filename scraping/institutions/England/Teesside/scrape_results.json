It explains how algorithms and data structure can be integrated to construct solutions that can be applied to resolve complex computational tasks. Classic puzzles and recreational games will be used to demonstrate the fundamental building blocks of algorithms. Knowledge of design principles and proficiency in creating algorithmic procedures is developed by cultivating an ability to think computationally in solving puzzles and creating routines for playing simple, computer-enabled games. Assessment for the module will require students to build a portfolio of artefacts demonstrating their knowledge and ability to apply computational thinking principles to problem-solving and the design of algorithmic solutions. This may involve designing and implementing suitable algorithms and data structure for solving a puzzle or implementing a simple board game.</font>",
